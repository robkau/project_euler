PROBLEM:   The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
           The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
           Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten numbers and the square of the sum is,

                                                     3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

           Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred numbers and the square of the sum

APPROACH:  Loop over the numbers and perform the operations.

RESULT:    It works. Runtime is nearly instant.
